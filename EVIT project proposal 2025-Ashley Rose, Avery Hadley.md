Level 1:

* The title of our game is the Java mama cafe simulator. We choose this because java is the name of a coding language and a well known name for coffee. Mama rhymes with java and opens up our back story. 

Level 2:

* Our cafe game will be an adventure based game that combines resource-management and level based progression in order to leave the user with a fun lively cartoonish game. As the game progresses through long term time stamps i.e. 30 days, the user will have only just started their adventure. 

Level 3:

* After starting her internship at her fiance's family owned law firm, Rosie begins to believe that everything is falling into place and she finally has her life together. Rosie, after believing she is with child, takes a test after sending a picture of the positive test to her fiance; he confesses that he has been cheating on her for the past 9 months and storms out of her life forever. Rosie feeling betrayed and in shock pulls herself together and goes to the firm the next day to find a letter of termination on her desk, alongside the box for her to return her engagement ring to. Rosi abruptly leaves the office with nothing but the ring and eyes filled with tears. Rosie welcomes her baby girl into the world alone, with only her apartment to show for it, but she promises to give her daughter Daisy a better life than if her father had been in it.  
* On Daisy’s third birthday, Rosie receives a call from her landlord explaining that he is too old to continue keeping up with the apartment downstairs and he must sell the town house that they live in. Rosie decides to use up every cent to her name and buys the town house. She decides to turn the lower level into a cafe, and her journey begins Rosie has to find a way to refill her savings account while still providing for her daughter daisy and cat named lama,

* Side character: Brady, the law student that got Rosie pregnant that dropped out of her life after hearing the news. Also got her fired from his family law firm she was interning at.   
* Llama: her friendly cat. 

Level 5:

* Our age group is adults/ older adults from the ages of 18+. They would enjoy it for its drama-filled story and its simulator-like playstyle that mimics a real cafe environment. 

Level 6:

* As the days continue, more and more customers come to her cafe. This makes it so each day the amount of orders the user completes becomes more. The user must buy supplies like milk, coffee beans, and cups. They must do this while still saving up enough money for when rent is due at the end of the month. 

Level 7:

* Our game stands out  because it connects with an older demographic by looping in drama and adventuring into the story. Our game will be cartoon based. Our game is based on long term time stamps that gives the user a deadlines to reach.

Level 8:

* I've played many cafe games before that are all simulator games that mostly have a similar playstyle. I liked the first-person aspect of them, it makes them feel more atmospheric and real. I however wanted to have more of a story for a background then just a "simulator game”. It will have levels and character backstory in addition to all the simulator aspects. 

Level 8:

* People should feel the emotion of Rosie while being empowered to create their own cafe. They should also feel slightly intimidated by the clock that's counting down to the time they have left to make the money for the mortgage.
